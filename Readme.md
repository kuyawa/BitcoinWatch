# BITCOIN WATCH

Bitcoin Watch is a simple watchOS application that displays the BTC price of the moment plus volume and market capitalization using CoinMarketCap API. It has a delay of one minute for consecutive price requests.

This is my first watchOS app. I can do server, desktop, mobile and now watch apps, will soon try tvOS apps too. Stay tuned.
